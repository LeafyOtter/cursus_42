# 42 Cursus
 
42 is a software engineering school located in several countries.
This repository contains all my finished projects from my cursus.

## Content of the repository

- Libft is the first project of the cursus. It consists to re-implement some standard libc functions.
(This folder also contains get_next_line and printf)

- Get_next_line is the second project i finished.
This project makes us write a function to read a line.
Called in a loop it can be used to read an entire file.

- Ft_printf is pretty straightforward, we had to re-implement the printf function.
We didn't have to implement all options and flags, some of them were in the bonus section.
My implementation take care of most of the flags. It can't handle float numbers though.

- Ft_server is about implementing a small server, runned in a docker container.
The server use nginx, mariaDB, phpMyAdmin, and WordPress.
Although this project has a lot of flaws, it was pretty interesting.

- Cub3D is certainly the biggest project of this repo at the moment.
It's about recreating a basic ray-casting game engine, while using a pretty limited graphic library (the minilibx).

- Fract_ol is a graphical project, consisting of creating several fractals.
It is not actually quite functional. But because of change in cursus, i don't actually need to do it.
I will finish it once my main cursus is done.  

## Current projects

- Minishell, is a group project consisting of creating our own mini shell.

- Minitalk, is a project about unix signal. It is finished, i just need to do some testing, and then get it corrected.

- Philosophers, is a project about multi-threading. It is temporarly stopped, since i'm focusing on minishell.

## Notes

I will update this repository regularly to add more project.

This repository serves as a vault for my projects.  
Btw, if anyone from 42 come here while searching for some answer,
i hope my code will be able to help you.  
Don't copy paste though, it's useless. You will learn nothing, and probably get in trouble.
