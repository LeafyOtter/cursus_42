# Libft

This repo compile most of the C function i've written for my cursus at 42 Paris.

## List of included projects

	- ft_printf
	- get_next_line
	- libft (obviously)

## Some info

For the exact list of functions of libft, i invite you includes/libft.h.  
I may add a nice formated list in the futur.

For some reason my header seems to have bugged. This project was not realised in 2018 but 2020 with revision in 2021.
